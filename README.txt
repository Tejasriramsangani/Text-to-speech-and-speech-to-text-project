# TTS and STT Application in ReactJS

This is a ReactJS application that utilizes Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) functionalities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- NPM (version X.X.X)
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Install the project dependencies:


### Usage

1. Start the development server:


2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. The application consists of two main features:

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
  - Enter the desired text in the input field.
  - Click the "Speak" button to hear the text being spoken.
  
- **Speech-to-Text (STT):**
  - Click the microphone button to start recording.
  - Speak clearly and enunciate your words.
  - Click the microphone button again to stop recording.
  - The recognized text will be displayed on the screen.

### Customization

You can customize the application by modifying the following files:

- `src/components/TTS.js`: Contains the implementation of the Text-to-Speech functionality.
- `src/components/STT.js`: Contains the implementation of the Speech-to-Text functionality.
- `src/App.js`: Contains the main application structure.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your requirements.
